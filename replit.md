- **Performance Fixes**: Reduced database timeouts from 10s to 1s, added graceful fallbacks, fixed ObjectId compatibility issues
- **Dynamic Category System (January 14, 2025)**: Fully implemented dynamic category extraction from any MongoDB URI - system now automatically detects and maps categories like "starters" → "Starters", "mains" → "Main Course", "drinks" → "Beverages", etc. Added refresh categories functionality with visual category display in UI
- **Replit Environment Setup (January 14, 2025)**: Completed migration to Replit environment with proper MongoDB Atlas connection, dotenv configuration, and PostgreSQL database setup for full compatibility
- **MongoDB Integration Complete (January 15, 2025)**: Successfully connected to user's MongoDB Atlas database (DigitalMenuQR) with proper authentication and data structure alignment. Updated menu item schema to match exact MongoDB format with 'veg' field instead of 'isVeg', implemented proper field mapping for all CRUD operations, and ensured all menu items follow the exact structure from the database screenshot
- **UI/Layout Fixes (January 14, 2025)**: Fixed restaurant card action button layout using flexbox with proper spacing and responsive design. Resolved authentication issues causing JSON parsing errors in Admin Settings panel
- **QR Code Integration (January 14, 2025)**: Added optional website field to restaurant form with automatic QR code generation using qrcode library. QR codes are displayed in restaurant dashboard and stored in database. When scanned, QR codes redirect to restaurant websites
- **QR Code Modal & Admin Settings (January 14, 2025)**: Created QR code popup modal with zoomed view for easier scanning and clickable website links. Added comprehensive admin settings panel with profile management, theme customization (6 color themes), security settings, and system configuration options

- **Admin Password Change Fix (January 15, 2025)**: Fixed admin settings password change functionality to properly validate current password against stored fallback password instead of hardcoded value, enabling correct password updates and validation flow
- **Collection-Based Category System (January 15, 2025)**: Completely restructured menu system to fetch categories from MongoDB collection names instead of menu items. Each collection (drinks, starters, desserts, etc.) becomes a category, and menu items are fetched per collection. Added new API endpoint for category-specific menu fetching using exact collection names without any mapping - categories are strictly limited to only the collection names that exist in the database. Fixed menu item creation and editing to save items in the correct collection based on their category, including support for empty collections like "chefspecial" and "maincourse"
- **MongoDB Atlas Integration Complete (January 15, 2025)**: Successfully migrated project from Replit Agent to Replit environment with direct MongoDB Atlas connection using provided MONGODB_URI. Updated all menu item schemas to match exact MongoDB document structure with fields: _id, name, description, price, category, isVeg, image, restaurantId, isAvailable, createdAt, updatedAt, __v. System now properly handles 9 collections (bread, chefspecial, combos, desserts, drinks, maincourse, ricebiryani, soups, starters) with 18 total menu items from maharajafeast database
- **Vegetarian Field Standardization (January 15, 2025)**: Completed migration to use only `isVeg` field in MongoDB database. Removed duplicate `veg` field to prevent confusion and maintain data consistency. System now stores only `isVeg: false` for non-vegetarian items and `isVeg: true` for vegetarian items. Maintained backward compatibility for reading existing records that may have the old `veg` field. Fixed vegetarian/non-vegetarian toggle functionality in admin interface
- **Bulk Menu Import Feature (January 15, 2025)**: Added comprehensive Excel-based bulk menu import functionality. Features include: downloadable Excel template with restaurant-specific categories, file upload with validation, batch processing with progress tracking, detailed error reporting, and automatic data mapping. Templates include sample data and category reference sheets. Supports all menu item fields including vegetarian status, availability, and custom restaurant categories. Integrated seamlessly with existing menu management system
- **Local Image Upload Feature (January 15, 2025)**: Added local image upload functionality for menu items. Users can now upload images directly from their computer instead of requiring image URLs. Features include: file type validation (images only), 1MB size limit, image preview functionality, remove image option, automatic image serving through Express static middleware, and unique filename generation. Images are stored in uploads/ directory and served at /uploads/ path. System supports both local upload and URL input with dynamic switching. Fixed ES module compatibility issues for proper file handling
- **Bulk Import Category Matching Fix (January 15, 2025)**: Resolved critical issue where bulk import was placing menu items in incorrect categories due to loose category matching. Implemented strict validation in fetchMenuItemsFromCustomDB function to only return items where category field exactly matches collection name. Fixed import logic to use exact collection names (rice → rice, ricewithgravy → ricewithgravy, etc.) without any name transformations. System now correctly places imported items in their designated collections preventing cross-category contamination. Tested and verified with rice, noodle, ricewithgravy, and potrice categories

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` runs both frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx)
- **Database**: Uses Neon PostgreSQL database via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx watch mode for backend

### Production
- **Build Process**: 
  1. `vite build` compiles frontend to `dist/public`
  2. `esbuild` bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Single Node.js process serving both static files and API
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL database required

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection
- **Static Files**: Express serves built frontend from `dist/public`
- **API Routes**: Backend handles `/api/*` routes, frontend handles client-side routing

The application follows a traditional client-server architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend, unified by shared TypeScript schemas and a luxurious royal theme throughout the user experience.
